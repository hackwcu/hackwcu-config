Even though we would like to help everyone get to <%= HackumassWeb::Application::HACKATHON_NAME %> <%= HackumassWeb::Application::HACKATHON_VERSION %>, we simply don’t have enough funds. Because of this, travel reimbursements will not be offered.

If you have any questions please visit our website at <%= HackumassWeb::Application::MAIN_WEBSITE %>. If you can’t find your answer on our website, then please feel free to shoot us an email at <%= HackumassWeb::Application::CONTACT_EMAIL %> and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

Thanks again for registering for our event, and we look forward to seeing you there!
